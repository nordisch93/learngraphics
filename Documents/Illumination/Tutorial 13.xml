    <title>Lies and Impostors</title>
    <para>Lighting in these tutorials has ultimately been a form of deception. An increasingly
        accurate one, but it is deception all the same. We are not rendering round objects; we
        simply use lighting and interpolation of surface characteristics to make an object appear
        round. Sometimes we have artifacts or optical illusions that show the lie for what it is.
        Even when the lie is near-perfect, the geometry of a model still doesn't correspond to what
        the lighting makes the geometry appear to be.</para>
    <para>In this tutorial, we will be looking at the ultimate expression of this lie. We will use
        lighting computations to make an object appear to be something entirely different from its
        geometry.</para>

        <para>In this tutorial, you have learned the following:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Impostors are objects who's geometric representation has little or no
                    resemblance to what the viewer sees. These typically generate an object
                    procedurally by cutting fragments out to form a shape, and then use normals and
                    depth manipulation to do lighting computations on the cut-out.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Fragments can be discarded from within a fragment shader. This prevents the
                    outputs from the shader from being written to the final image.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Fragment shaders can change the depth value that is used for the depth test
                    and is written to the framebuffer.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Geometry shaders are a shader stage between the vertex shader and the
                    rasterizer. They take a primitive as input and return one or more primitives as
                    output.</para>
