    <title>Objects at Rest</title>
    <para>Thus far, we have seen very flat things. Namely, a single triangle. This tutorial is all
        about how to create a realistic world of objects.</para>
    <note>
        <title>Math Warning</title>
        <para>This tutorial, even moreso than some of the previous ones, is very heavy on text and
            light on code. The actual new code introduced in this tutorial is perhaps 30 lines. What
            is important here is why this is the correct code to do what we need to do. And that
            requires a lot of text.</para>
        <para>It requires a lot of math and geometry. The tutorial will explain everything
            step-by-step and in-depth, but understanding everything will exercise your math skills.
            Even worse, the code that we deal with here is usually boilerplate code. It's the kind
            of code that you write once and then use forever without having to go change it or
            usually understand how it works.</para>
        <para>These facts will tempt you to simply skip this tutorial and move on to the next.
            However, I strongly advise you to <emphasis>resist</emphasis> that temptation. I
            understand that math isn't the most interesting thing to most people (though to be
            honest, if math really bores or confuses you, you may want to re-think your desire to
            write graphics code). But understanding the concepts introduced in this tutorial is very
            important for understanding how the most fundamental part of triangle-based scan
            conversion works.</para>
