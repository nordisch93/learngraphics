        <para>One of the most important aspects of rendering is lighting. Thus far, all of our
            objects have had a color that is entirely part of the mesh data, pulled from a
            uniform variable, or computed in an arbitrary way. This makes all of our objects
            look very flat and unrealistic.</para>
        <para>Properly modeling the interaction between light and a surface is vital in creating
            a convincing world. Lighting defines how we see and understand shapes to a large
            degree. This is the reason why the objects we have used thus far look fairly flat. A
            curved surface appears curved to us because of how the light plays over the surface.
            The same goes for a flat surface. Without this visual hinting, surfaces appear flat
            even when they are modeled with many triangles and yield a seemingly-curved
            polygonal mesh.</para>
        <para>A proper lighting model makes objects appear real. A poor or inconsistent lighting
            model shows the virtual world to be the forgery that it is. The tutorials in this
            section will introduce some light/surface models and explain how to implement
            them.</para>
