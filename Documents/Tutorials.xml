            <para>These tutorials involve the most basic operations for OpenGL. They deal with the
                core of the OpenGL pipeline. These provide core information about how OpenGL works,
                how its pipeline works, what the basic flow of information is within OpenGL.</para>

            <para>These tutorials give the reader information about how objects are positioned in 3D
                graphics and OpenGL. These deal with transforming the position of objects, as well
                as doing what is necessary to make those objects appear as though they are in a
                3-dimensional space.</para>

            <para>One of the most important aspects of rendering is lighting. Thus far, all of our
                objects have had a color that is entirely part of the mesh data, pulled from a
                uniform variable, or computed in an arbitrary way. This is not how color works in
                the real world.</para>
            <para>Properly modeling the interaction between light and a surface is vital in creating
                a convincing world. The tutorials in this section will introduce some simple
                light/surface models and explain how to implement them.</para>

            <para>Lookup tables in rendering are usually called textures. This is due to the fact
                that the main use for them is to modify the appearance of a surface. Even so,
                textures have many uses.</para>

            <para>Simple diffuse lighting and directional shadows are useful, but better, more
                effective lighting models and patterns exist. These tutorials will explore those,
                from Phong lighting to reflections to HDR and blooming.</para>
